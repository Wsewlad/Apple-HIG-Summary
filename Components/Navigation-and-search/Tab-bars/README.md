# Tab bars
## Best practices
- Use a tab bar only for navigation, not to help people perform actions.
- Make sure the tab bar is visible when people navigate to different areas in your app.
- Use the minimum number of tabs required to help people navigate your app.
- Keep tabs visible even when their content is unavailable.
- Use concrete nouns or verbs as tab titles.

- Avoid overflow tabs whenever possible.
- In an iPadOS app, consider using a sidebar instead of a tab bar.
- Ensure that tabs affect the view thatâ€™s attached to the tab bar, not views elsewhere onscreen.
- Use a badge to communicate unobtrusively.
- Consider using SF Symbols to provide scalable, visually consistent tab bar items.
