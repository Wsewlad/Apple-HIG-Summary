# Navigation bars
## Best practices
- Use the title area to describe the current screen if it provides useful context.
- Write a concise screen title.
- Consider temporarily hiding the navigation bar to provide a more immersive experience.
- Use the standard back button.
- Make sure buttons that use text labels have enough room.
- Consider using a segmented control in a navigation bar to flatten the information hierarchy.
- Use a large title to help people stay oriented as they navigate and scroll.
