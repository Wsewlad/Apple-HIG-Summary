# Sidebars
## Best practices
- Use a sidebar to help people quickly navigate to key areas of your app or top-level collections of content, like folders and playlists. 
- When possible, let people customize the contents of a sidebar.
- Consider letting people hide the sidebar.
- In general, show no more than two levels of hierarchy in a sidebar.
- If you need to include two levels of hierarchy in a sidebar, use succinct, descriptive labels to title each group.

- In an iOS app, consider using a tab bar instead of a sidebar.
- In an iPadOS app, consider using a sidebar instead of a tab bar.
- If necessary, apply the correct appearance to a sidebar.
