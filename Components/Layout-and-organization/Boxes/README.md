# Boxes
## Best practices
- Prefer keeping a box relatively small in comparison with its containing view.
- Consider using padding and alignment to communicate additional grouping within a box.

## Content
- Provide a succinct introductory title if it helps clarify the boxâ€™s contents.
- If you need a title, write a brief phrase that describes the contents.
