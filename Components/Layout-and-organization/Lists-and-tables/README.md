# Lists and tables
## Best practices
- Prefer displaying text in a list or table.
- Let people edit a table when it makes sense.
- Provide appropriate feedback when people select a list item.

## Content
- Keep item text succinct so row content is comfortable to read.
- Consider ways to preserve readability of text that might otherwise get clipped or truncated.
- Use descriptive column headings in a multicolumn table.

## Style
- Choose a table or list style that coordinates with your data and platform.
- Choose a row style that fits the information you need to display.
- Use an info button only to reveal more information about a row’s content.
- Avoid adding an index to a table that displays controls — like disclosure indicators — in the trailing ends of its rows.
