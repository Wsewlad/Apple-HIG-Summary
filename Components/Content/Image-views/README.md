# Image views
## Best practices
- Use an image view when the primary purpose of the view is simply to display an image.
- If you want to display an icon in your interface, consider using a symbol or interface icon instead of an image view.

## Content
- Take care when overlaying text on images.
- Aim to use a consistent size for all images in an animated sequence.
