# Pull-down buttons
## Best practices
- Use a pull-down button to present commands or items that are directly related to the button’s action.
- Avoid putting all of a view’s actions in one pull-down button.
- Balance menu length with ease of use.
- Display a succinct menu title only if it adds meaning.
- Let people know when a pull-down button’s menu item is destructive, and ask them to confirm their intent.
- Include an interface icon with a menu item when it provides value.
- Consider using a More pull-down button to present items that don’t need prominent positions in the main interface.
