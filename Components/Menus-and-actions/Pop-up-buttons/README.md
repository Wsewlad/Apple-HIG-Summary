# Pop-up buttons
## Best practices
- Use a pop-up button to present a flat list of mutually exclusive options or states.
- Provide a useful default selection.
- Give people a way to predict a pop-up button’s options without opening it.
- Consider using a pop-up button when space is limited and you don’t need to display all options all the time.
- If necessary, include a Custom option in a pop-up button’s menu to provide additional items that are useful in some situations.
