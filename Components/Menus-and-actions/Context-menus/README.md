# Context menus
## Best practices
- Prioritize relevancy when choosing items to include in a context menu.
- Aim for a small number of menu items.
- Support context menus consistently throughout your app.
- Always make context menu items available in the main interface, too.
- If you need to use submenus to manage a menu’s complexity, keep them to one level.
- Aim to place the most frequently used menu items where people are likely to focus first.
- Show keyboard shortcuts in your app’s main menus, not in context menus.
- Follow best practices for using separators.

- In general, avoid adding a title to a context menu.
- Include a symbol or interface icon with each command in a context menu.
- Provide either a context menu or an edit menu for an item, but not both.
- Warn people about context menu items that can destroy data.
- In iPadOS, consider using a context menu to let people create a new object in your app.
- Prefer a graphical preview that clarifies the target of a context menu’s commands.
- Ensure that your preview looks good as it animates.
