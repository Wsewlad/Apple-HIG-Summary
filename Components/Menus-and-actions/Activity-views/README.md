# Activity views
## Best practices
- Avoid creating duplicate versions of common actions that are already available in the activity view.
- Consider using a symbol to represent your custom activity.
- Write a succinct, descriptive title for each custom action you provide.
- Make sure activities are appropriate for the current context.
- Use the Share button to display an activity view.

## Share and action extensions
- If necessary, create a custom interface that feels familiar to people.
- Streamline and limit interaction. 
- Avoid placing a modal view above your extension.
- If necessary, provide an image that communicates the purpose of your extension.
- Use your main app to denote the progress of a lengthy operation.
