# Menus
## Labels
- To help people understand what a menu item does, write a label that clearly and succinctly describes it.
- For consistent labels, adopt a condensed style that doesn’t include articles, and use title-style capitalization.
- Append an ellipsis to a menu item’s label when people need to provide additional information before the action can complete.
- Show people when a menu item is unavailable.

## Toggled items
- Consider using changeable titles to shorten a long list of items that show and hide features.
- Use a changeable label when there isn’t enough room to list a pair of menu items.
- Consider using a checkmark when a toggled item represents an attribute that’s currently in effect.
- Consider offering a menu item that makes it easy to remove multiple toggled attributes.
- Consider displaying a pair of menu items instead of one toggled menu item if it adds clarity.

## Organization
- List menu items according to your prioritization scheme.
- Avoid letting your prioritization scheme separate a group of commands that are logically related, even if the commands don’t all have the same priority.
- Be mindful of menu length.

## Submenus
- Use submenus sparingly.
- Limit the depth and length of submenus.
- Make sure a submenu remains available even when its nested menu items are unavailable.
- Prefer using a submenu to indenting menu items.
