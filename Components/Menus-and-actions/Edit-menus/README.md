# Edit menus
## Best practices
- Prefer the system-provided edit menu.
- Let people reveal an edit menu using the system-defined interactions they already know.
- Offer commands that are relevant in the current context, removing or dimming commands that donâ€™t apply.
- List custom commands near relevant system-provided ones.
- When it makes sense, let people select and copy noneditable text.
- Support undo and redo when possible.
- In general, avoid implementing other controls that perform the same functions as edit menu items.
- Differentiate different types of deletion commands when necessary.
