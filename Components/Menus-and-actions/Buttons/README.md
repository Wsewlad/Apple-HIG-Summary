# Buttons
## Best practices
- Make buttons easy for people to choose.
- Ensure that each button clearly communicates it purpose.

## Style
- Use a filled button for the most likely action in a view.
- Use style — not size — to visually distinguish the preferred choice among multiple options.

## Content
- Create button content that helps people instantly understand what the button does.
- Include additional text below the label only if it provides useful details.
- Configure a button to display an activity indicator when you need to provide feedback about an action that doesn’t instantly complete.

## Role
- Assign the primary role to the button people are most likely to choose.
- Don’t assign the primary role to a button that performs a destructive action, even if that action is the most likely choice.
