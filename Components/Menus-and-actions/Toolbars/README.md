# Toolbars
## Best practices
- Provide toolbar items that support the main tasks people perform.
- Avoid displaying too many toolbar items.
- Make sure the meaning of each toolbar item is clear.
- Prefer system-provided symbols or interface icons.
- Prefer a consistent appearance for all toolbar items.
- If a toolbar item toggles between two states, make sure the item clearly communicates the current state.
- Be prepared for translucency in the toolbar when content flows beneath it.
- Avoid using a segmented control in a toolbar.
- In a toolbar that contains three or fewer buttons, consider using concise text labels instead of symbols to add clarity.
- In a toolbar that has more than three buttons, consider using symbols to conserve space.
