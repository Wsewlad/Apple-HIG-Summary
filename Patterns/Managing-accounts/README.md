# Managing accounts
## Best practices
- Explain the benefits of creating an account and how to sign up.
- Delay sign-in for as long as possible.
- If you don’t use Sign in with Apple in your iOS, iPadOS, or macOS app, prefer using a passkey. 
- Always identify the authentication method you offer.
- Refer only to authentication methods that are available in the current context.
- In general, avoid offering an app-specific setting for opting in to biometric authentication.
- Avoid using the term passcode to refer to account authentication.

## Deleting accounts
- Provide a clear way to initiate account deletion within your app or game.
- Provide a consistent account-deletion experience whether people perform it within your app or game or on the website.
- Consider letting people schedule account deletion to occur in the future.
- Tell people when account deletion will complete, and notify them when it’s finished.
- If you support in-app purchases, help people understand how billing and cancellation work when they delete their account.
