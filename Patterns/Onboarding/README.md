# Onboarding
## Best practices
- Design a brief, enjoyable experience that doesnâ€™t require people to memorize or provide a lot of information.
- Prefer teaching through interactivity.
- As an alternative to a separate onboarding flow, consider integrating brief onboarding elements into the main experience.
- If you offer a tutorial, give people a way to skip it.
- Avoid displaying licensing details within your onboarding flow.
