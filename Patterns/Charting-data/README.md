# Charting data
## Best practices
- Use a chart when you want to highlight important information about a dataset.
- Keep a chart simple, letting people choose when they want additional details.
- Make every chart in your app accessible.

## Designing effective charts
- In general, prefer using common chart types.
- If you need to create a chart that presents data in a novel way, help people learn how to interpret the chart.
- Examine the data from multiple levels or perspectives to find details you can display to enhance the chart.
- Aid comprehension by adding descriptive text to the chart.
- Match the size of a chart to its functionality, focus, and level of detail.
- Prefer consistency across multiple charts, deviating only when you need to highlight differences.
