## Best practices
- Make your appâ€™s content searchable.
- Define metadata for custom file types you handle.
- Use Spotlight to offer advanced file-search capabilities within the context of your app.
- Prefer using the system-provided open and save views.
- Implement a Quick Look generator if your app produces custom file types.
