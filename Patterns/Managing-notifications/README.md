# Managing notifications
## Integrating with Focus
- A Focus helps people filter notifications during a time period they reserve for an activity like sleeping, working, reading, or driving.
- Even though a Focus might delay the delivery of a notification alert, the notification itself is available as soon as it arrives.
- You need to specify a system-defined interruption level for each noncommunication notification you send (**Passive, Active (the default), Time Sensitive, Critical**).

#### Because a Critical notification can override the Ring/Silent switch and break through scheduled delivery and Focus, you must get an entitlement to send one.

## Best practices
- Build trust by accurately representing the urgency of each notification.
- Use the Time Sensitive interruption level only for notifications that are relevant in the moment.

## Sending marketing notifications
- Never use the Time Sensitive interruption level to send a marketing notification.
- Get peopleâ€™s permission if you want to send them promotional or marketing notifications.
- Make sure people can manage their notification settings within your app.
