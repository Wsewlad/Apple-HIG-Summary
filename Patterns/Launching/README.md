# Launching
## Best practices
- Provide a launch screen if the platform requires it.
- Ask for initial setup information only when necessary.
- Give people time to start enjoying your app before showing supplementary information, asking for a review, or making permission requests.
- Restore the previous state when your app restarts so people can continue where they left off.

## Launch screens
- Design a launch screen that’s nearly identical to the first screen of your app.
- Avoid including text on your launch screen.
- Downplay the launch experience.
- Don’t advertise.
- Launch in the appropriate orientation.
