# Entering data
## Best practices
- Get information from the system whenever possible.
- Be clear about the data you need.
- Use a secure text-entry field when appropriate.
- Never prepopulate a password field.
- Dynamically validate field values.
- When possible, offer choices instead of requiring text entry.
- As much as possible, let people provide data by dragging and dropping it or by pasting it.
- When data is truly required, allow advancement only after collecting it.
