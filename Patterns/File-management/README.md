# File management
## Opening files
- Use app menus and keyboard shortcuts to give people convenient ways to create and open documents.
- Reflect people’s view of the file system within a custom file-opening interface.
- Consider ways to make your custom file-opening interface more convenient.

## Saving work
- Help people be confident that their work is always preserved unless they cancel or delete it.
- Provide a save interface to let people change a file’s name, format, or location.
- Hide the file extension by default, but let people view it if they choose.
- Extend the functionality of the Save dialog, if appropriate.

## Quick Look previews
- When someone uses your file provider extension to open or import documents, display only documents that are appropriate in the current context.
- Let people select a destination when exporting and moving documents.
- Avoid including a custom navigation bar.
