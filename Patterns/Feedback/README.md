# Feedback
## Best practices
- Make sure all feedback is accessible.
- Consider integrating status feedback into your interface.
- Use alerts to deliver critical — and ideally actionable — information.
- Warn people when they initiate a task that can cause data loss that’s unexpected and irreversible.
- When it makes sense, confirm that a significant action or task has completed.
- Show people when a command can’t be carried out and help them understand why.
