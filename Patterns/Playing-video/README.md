# Playing video
## Best practices
- Use the system video player to give people a familiar and convenient experience.
- Always display video content at its original aspect ratio.
- Provide additional information when it adds value.
- Support the interactions people expect, regardless of the device theyâ€™re using to control playback.
- If people need to access playback options or content-specific information in your tvOS app, consider adding a transport control or a custom content tab.
- Avoid allowing audio from different sources to mix as viewers switch between full-screen and PiP modes.

## Integrating with the TV app
- Ensure a smooth transition to your app.
- Show the expected content immediately. 
- Avoid asking people if they want to resume playback.
- Play or pause playback when people press Space on a connected Bluetooth keyboard.
- Make sure content plays for the correct viewer.
- Use the previous end time when resuming playback of a long video clip.

## Loading content
- Avoid displaying loading screens when possible.
- Start playback immediately.
- Minimize loading screen content.

## Exiting playback
- Show a contextually relevant screen.
- Be prepared for an immediate exit.
