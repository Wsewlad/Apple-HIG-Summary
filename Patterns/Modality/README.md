# Modality
## Best practices
- Present content modally only when there’s a clear benefit.
- Aim to keep modal tasks simple, short, and narrowly focused.
- Take care to avoid creating a modal experience that feels like an app within your app.
- Consider using a full-screen modal style for immersive content or a complex task.
- Always give people an obvious way to dismiss a modal view.
- When necessary, help people avoid data loss by getting confirmation before closing a modal view.
- Make it easy to identify a modal view’s task.
- Avoid presenting a modal view on top of another modal view.
