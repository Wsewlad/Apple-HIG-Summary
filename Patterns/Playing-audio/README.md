# Playing audio
## Best practices
- Adjust levels automatically when necessary — don’t adjust the overall volume.
- Permit rerouting of audio when possible.
- Use the system-provided volume view to let people make audio adjustments.
- Choose an audio category that fits the way your app or game uses sound.
- Respond to audio controls only when it makes sense.
- Avoid repurposing audio controls.
- Consider creating custom audio player controls only if you need to offer commands that the system doesn’t support.
- Let other apps know when your app finishes playing temporary audio.

## Handling interruptions
- Determine how to respond to audio-session interruptions.
- When an interruption ends, determine whether to resume audio playback automatically.
