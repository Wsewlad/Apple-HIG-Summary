# Collaboration and sharing
## Best practices
- Place the Share button in a convenient location, like a toolbar, to make it easy for people to start sharing or collaborating.
- If necessary, customize the share sheet or sharing popover to offer the types of file sharing your app supports.
- Write succinct phrases that summarize the sharing permissions you support.
- Provide a set of simple sharing options that streamline collaboration setup.
- Prominently display the collaboration button as soon as collaboration starts.
- Provide custom actions in the collaboration popover only if needed.
- If it makes sense in your app, customize the title of the popoverâ€™s collaboration-management button.
- Consider posting collaboration event notifications in Messages.
