# Ratings and reviews
## Best practices
- Ask for a rating only after people have demonstrated engagement with your app or game.
- Avoid interrupting people while theyâ€™re performing a task or playing a game.
- Avoid pestering people.
- Prefer the system-provided prompt.
- Weigh the benefits of resetting your summary rating against the potential disadvantage of showing fewer ratings.

##### The system automatically limits the display of the prompt to three occurrences per app within a 365-day period.
