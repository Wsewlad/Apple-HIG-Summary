# Settings
## Best practices
- As much as possible, let people modify task-specific options without going to a settings area.
- When necessary, put app-level options in a separate settings area.
- Minimize the number of settings you offer.
- Respect peopleâ€™s systemwide settings and avoid including redundant versions of them in your app-specific settings area.
- Avoid using in-app settings to ask for setup information you can get in other ways.
- Add only the most rarely changed options to the system-provided settings apps.
- Make your in-app settings easy to find, but not too prominent.
- In macOS and iPadOS apps, make settings available in ways people expect.
