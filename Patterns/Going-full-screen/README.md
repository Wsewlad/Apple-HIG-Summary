# Going full screen
## Best practices
- Support full-screen mode when it makes sense for your experience.
- Maintain access to essential app features so people can complete their task without exiting full-screen mode.
- In general, let people reveal the Dock while an iPadOS or macOS app is in full-screen mode.
- If necessary, adjust your interface to take advantage of the full-screen space.
- Let people choose when to exit full-screen mode.
- Allow auto-hiding of the Home Screen indicator when it makes sense.
