#### Designing an app or game with accessibility in mind is crucial to ensure that it provides a great user experience for everyone, regardless of their capabilities or how they interact with their devices. Here are some best practices to follow when designing for accessibility:

1. **Prioritize simplicity and perceivability:** Design your app to enable familiar and consistent interactions, making complex tasks simple and straightforward to perform. Ensure that all content can be perceived using sight, hearing, or touch.

2. **Support personalization:** Design your app to support the accessibility features people use to personalize their interaction with their devices. Use standard components that automatically adapt to accessibility settings such as Bold Text, Larger Text, Invert Colors, and Increase Contrast.

3. **Audit and test for accessibility:** Conduct an audit of your app or game to identify any accessibility issues and create a comprehensive list of items to fix. Test your app with accessibility features turned on to ensure that everyone can complete important tasks without difficulty.

4. **Don't override platform gestures:** People expect system gestures to work consistently across different apps. Avoid overriding platform gestures and prefer simplified gestures for common interactions, as complex gestures can be challenging for many users. Provide alternative ways to perform gesture-based actions.

5. **Use larger hit targets:** Give all touchscreen controls and interactive elements a hit target that measures at least 44x44 points. This helps users with limited mobility interact with your app more easily.

6. **Characterize custom elements:** Use system APIs to characterize custom elements, such as buttons, to help assistive technologies understand their behavior. This ensures that VoiceOver provides appropriate feedback to users.

7. **Provide alternatives for user input:** Enable people to input information by speaking instead of typing. Include a dictation button in text entry fields and support Siri or Shortcuts for performing important tasks by voice alone. Avoid preventing people from selecting plain text when possible.

8. **Support system-defined haptics:** Utilize the system-defined haptics consistently in your app to provide feedback and assist users who rely on haptic feedback to interact with the app.

9. **Provide alternative descriptions for images:** Describe meaningful images in your content to ensure that VoiceOver users can fully experience your app. Focus on information conveyed by the image itself and consider providing concise descriptions for infographics and making them fully accessible.

10. **Enable navigation and structure:** Ensure VoiceOver users can navigate to every element by providing accessibility information for onscreen elements. Specify how elements should be grouped, ordered, or linked to improve the VoiceOver experience. Notify VoiceOver when onscreen content or layout changes.

11. **Support closed captions and audio descriptions:** Provide closed captions, audio descriptions, and transcripts for video and audio content to enable everyone to benefit from the content in different ways.

12. **Use Dynamic Type and adapt to font sizes:** Use Dynamic Type to allow users to pick the font size that works for them. Test your app's layout to ensure it adapts to all font sizes and remains legible.

##### By following these best practices, you can create an accessible app or game that provides a great user experience for people with disabilities or different ways of interacting with their devices.
