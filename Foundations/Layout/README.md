#### Here are some best practices for designing a layout that adapts to various contexts:

1. Design a consistent layout that adapts gracefully to context changes while displaying the same content as much as possible.

2. Respect system-defined safe areas, margins, and guides while specifying layout modifiers to fine-tune the placement of views in your hierarchy.

3. Respect key display and system features in each platform, and accommodate features like the corner radius and sensor housings on various devices.

4. Use placement to convey relative importance, and place principal items in the upper half of the screen or window, near the leading side.

5. Elevate essential information by giving it sufficient space and avoiding clutter on the screen or window.

6. Create visual groupings to help people find the information they want, such as using negative space, background shapes, colors, and materials, or separator lines to display related elements and information in distinct areas.

7. Use alignment to ease visual scanning and to communicate organization and hierarchy, and use indentation and alignment to help people visualize an information hierarchy.

8. Be mindful of aspect ratio, and scale artwork to fill the screen while maintaining the aspect ratio so that important visual content remains in view on all display sizes.

9. Be prepared for text-size changes, and adjust the layout to accommodate text-size changes.

10. Preview your app on multiple devices, using different orientations, localizations, and text sizes, and use Xcode Simulator to check for clipping and other layout issues.
