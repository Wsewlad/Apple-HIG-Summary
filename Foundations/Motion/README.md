#### Motion

- **Use motion to communicate.** For ex. when people set up Face ID, the system briefly describes what they need to do.
- **Add motion purposefully.** Don’t add motion for the sake of adding motion.
- **Make motion optional.** For example, when the Reduce Motion accessibility setting is on.
- **Strive for realism and credibility.** Accurate, realistic motion can help people understand how something works.
- **Prefer quick, precise animations.** It feels more lightweight and less intrusive.
- **In general, avoid adding motion to interactions that occur frequently.**

All layout- and appearance-based animations automatically include built-in easing that plays at the start and end of the animation. You can’t turn off or customize easing.
