#### Materials

##### Best practices:

- Choose system-defined materials and effects based on semantic meaning and recommended usage.
- Use only vibrant colors on top of materials to ensure legibility.
- Consider using SF Symbols instead of full-color icons.
- Consider contrast and visual separation when choosing a material to combine with blur and vibrancy effects. 
- Test the interface in a variety of contexts to discover when vibrancy enhances the appearance and improves communication.
- Choose a background blending mode that complements the interface design.
