#### As an iOS developer, here are the key points to know about color usage according to the Apple Human Interface Guidelines (HIG):

1. **Use color sparingly in nongame apps:** Overusing color can distract users and make communication less clear. Reserve color for important information or to show relationships within the interface.

2. **Maintain color consistency:** Use color consistently throughout your app, especially when it conveys information like status or interactivity. Avoid using the same color to mean different things.

3. **Support light and dark appearance modes:** Ensure your app's colors work well in both light and dark modes. Dark Mode uses a darker color palette, and system colors automatically adapt. If using custom colors, provide both light and dark variants.

4. **Test color schemes in different conditions:** Test your app's color scheme under various lighting conditions and on devices with different displays. Consider factors like True Tone display and color profiles to optimize the viewing experience.

5. **Consider artwork and translucency:** Account for variations in artwork that may require adjustments to nearby colors for visual continuity. Be mindful of how colors appear when placed behind or applied to translucent elements.

6. **Prefer system-provided color controls:** When allowing users to choose colors, use built-in color pickers for consistency and to allow users to access saved colors across apps.

7. **Ensure inclusivity:** Avoid relying solely on color to convey information or indicate interactivity. Provide alternative ways for people with visual disabilities to understand content. Avoid using colors that make it difficult to perceive content or have different cultural connotations.

8. **Understand system colors:** Avoid hard-coding system color values in your app. Use APIs like Color to apply system colors. Dynamic system colors automatically adapt to light and dark appearances.

9. **Consider color management:** Understand color spaces and profiles to ensure accurate color reproduction on different displays. Apply color profiles to your images and use wide color displays when appropriate.

10. **Platform-specific considerations:** iOS defines dynamic background colors to convey hierarchy in interfaces. Use system or grouped background colors based on the context of your app.

##### Remember, following these guidelines will help you create visually appealing and accessible iOS apps that align with Apple's design principles.
