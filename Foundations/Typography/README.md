# Typography
## Best practices
- Strive to maintain a minimum font size that most people can read easily.
- Adjust font weight, size, and color as needed to emphasize important information and help people visualize hierarchy.
- Minimize the number of typefaces you use in your interface.
- Test legibility in different contexts.
- In general, avoid light font weights to help maintain readability.
- Prioritize important content when responding to text-size changes.

## Using system fonts
- Consider using the built-in text styles.
- Modify the built-in text styles if necessary.
- Adjust tracking as needed in interface mockups.
