#### SF Symbols

Availability of individual symbols and features varies based on the version of the system you’re targeting.

##### Rendering modes
- **SF Symbols 3** and **later** provide four rendering modes — **monochrome, hierarchical, palette, and multicolor.**
- SF Symbols organizes a symbol’s paths into distinct layers.
- Confirm that a symbol’s rendering mode works well in every context.

##### Variable color
- Use variable color to communicate change — don’t use it to communicate depth.

##### Weights and scales
- Each of the nine symbol weights — from ultralight to black — corresponds to a weight of the San Francisco system font.

##### Design variants
- SF Symbols defines several design variants — such as outline, fill, slash, and enclosed.
- SF Symbols 3 and later provides many variants for specific languages.
- Symbol variants support a range of design goals.

##### Custom symbols
- Assign negative side margins to your custom symbol if necessary.
- Provide alternative text labels for custom symbols.
- Don’t design replicas of Apple products.
